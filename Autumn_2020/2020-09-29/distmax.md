There are N points on the 2D plane, i-th of which is located at (x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>). 
What is the maximum possible Manhattan distance between two distinct points?

(The Manhattan distance between 2 points (x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>) and (y<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>2</sub>) 
is |x<sub>1</sub>-x<sub>2</sub>| + |y<sub>1</sub>-y<sub>2</sub>|)

Implement the method below (change the template for your language)
```c++
int maxManhattan(int[] x_coords, int[] y_coords){

}
```
