Weekly Challenge - Complementary Colors
---

Given integer `n` and a list of `n` colors in RGB format (0-255 for each color), please find how many pairs of colors are complementary colors. A pair of colors `((R1, G1, B1), (R2, G2, B2))` is complementary colors when `R1 = 255 - R2, G1 = 255 - G2, B1 = 255 - B2`.

Sample input:

```
7
255 255 128
255 255 128
  0   0 127
  0   0 127
  0 100 200
255 155  55
100 100 100
```

Sample output:

```
5
```
