Weekly Challenge - Human Cannonball Run
---

There are lots of human cannons available at the International Human Cannonball Conference. You are navigating the conference. To travel quickly, in addition to running, you could find nearby cannons and launch yourself.

You run at 5m/s and all cannons launch you 50m in 2s. Given your location, a destination, and the positions of cannons, can you calculate the minimal time to travel?
