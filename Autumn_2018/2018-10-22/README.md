Suppose OSU Wireless will not available if we are outside of a building. Given the campus map, if we want to visit all the buildings on campus, how many times at least will we lose Wi-Fi connection?

Easy version: None of the buildings is surrounded by any other building(s).

Hard version: No restriction.

Sample input:

```
