Tile Painting:
Take the GCD of all of the factors of n besides 1. Any elements separated by distance equal to this GCD must be the same, otherwise
there is no restriction. The answer is then n/(the GCD).

0 - 1 MST:
Find the node with the most edges.
Merge that node with all nodes it is connected with. The graph is now
small enough that a normal MST algorithm will pass.

Make them similar:
Store possible bitcounts of the first 15 bits of elements
when xor ed with a number that ends with any combination of 15 bits. (Using hashmap)
For the last 15 bits, try xoring with each of the 2^15 possible numbers. Suppose that we do this,
then there are at most 15 possibilities of the result of the first 15 bits. Check in the
hashmap if any such values exist. If so, then you have found a solution.
