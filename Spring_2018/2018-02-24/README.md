Weekly Challenge - Big Truck
---

You are driving a big truck, transporting items around the city (an undirected graph). You are required to take a shortest path. However, your friend wants you to stop by several locations and pick up items for him. You want to pick up as many items as possible on your trip, but keep staying on a shortest path.

Your task is to calculate the length of the shortest path and the maximum number of items you can pick up.
