Weekly Challenge - Road Maintenance

Your big truck crushed all the roads in your city. The city government decided to do road maintenance. They can repair one mile per day. How many days in minimum does it require to make all the locations reachable?

The test data is the same as in [Big Truck](https://open.kattis.com/problems/bigtruck).

Sample input:

```
