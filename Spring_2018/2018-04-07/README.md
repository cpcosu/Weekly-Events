Weekly Challenge - Infinite Hanoi Theorem
---

A chimpanzee is playing The Tower of Hanoi with 2 disks. In each step, he always chooses a legal move randomly. Please calculate the probability he can win the game after `n` steps.

Given `n < 1000`, let the answer be `p`:

Problem (a): Calculate the float-point number `p`

Problem (b): Calculate the accurate value of `(p * 3^n) % (10^9 + 7)`

Problem (c): If `n < 10^18`, can you still solve (b)?
