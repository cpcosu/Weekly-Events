# Weekly Events
This repository contains slides and outlines documents of Competitive Programming Club (CPC) formerly ACM Club (ACM at Ohio State). Content was transfered from https://github.com/cpcosu/Weekly_Events this repository will now be maintained and updated regularly.

## About Us
We are a club that tries to challenge students to get really really good at problem solving. There is a very low entry barrier to getting started. Our meetings will introduce fun twists on classical algorithms, and provide interesting problems to work on your problem-solving abilities. Many recruits find the difficulty barrier daunting, but after continued exposure, problems that used to seem impossible will seem almost trivial!

Meetings will transition back to a hybrid format starting in Fall 2021. We will meet in-person but the meetings will also be recorded to Zoom. Weekly meetings and all events are open to the public but to be considered an official member of the club, you must attend at least 4 meetings per semester. 

## Resources
If you are interested in getting better at competitive programming, see [Lesson-Files](https://github.com/cpcosu/Lesson-Files). We currated our own set of resources for you to get better at Competitive Programming.

## Contribution
We want lectures from undergraduates like you! If you want to talk about a cool problem, just us know and we will schedule a time for you to talk. No need to prepare a 40-minute lecture; even 5-minute or informal contributions are greatly appreciated! If you do use lecture slides or show code, please make a fork of this repository and add it to the folder of the current semester and submit a pull request. Thanks!
